# goodreads-web-scraping
Web scraping project of GoodReads books-to-movies list

This is a scraping project of GoodReads books-that-should-be-made-into-movies website.

I used BeautifulSoup, a Python library, to scrape the information from the webpages and
Pandas, a Data Analysis Library, to manipulate the data to create custom columns and 
store the data in a csv file.

The scraping code loops over 11 webpages, collecting the book title, author name, average ratings,
no of ratings, scores and no of votes.
